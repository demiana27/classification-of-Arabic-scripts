Arabic script classification is a significant challenge due to the diverse styles, including Naskh, Thuluth, and Kufic, which require expertise and time to distinguish manually. Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has proven effective in automating this process by recognizing intricate patterns in Arabic scripts. Previous research has successfully utilized models like AlexNet and ResNet on large datasets to achieve high accuracy in Arabic font classification. Additionally, advancements in AI, such as Vision Transformers (ViT), have demonstrated the potential of transformer-based models for image recognition tasks, offering an alternative to CNNs. Other studies have explored deep learning techniques in various applications, including Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR), autonomous traffic sign recognition, Arabic sign language recognition, and air-writing detection, all of which highlight the effectiveness of CNNs, data augmentation, and transfer learning in improving classification accuracy. Despite progress, Arabic OCR still faces challenges due to its cursive nature, diacritics, and contextual letter shaping, leading researchers to enhance existing models through segmentation techniques and feature extraction. The increasing application of deep learning in Arabic script recognition contributes to the preservation of cultural heritage, digitization of historical texts, and automation of text classification, making this research crucial for advancing Arabic language processing. This study aims to improve Arabic script classification by leveraging deep learning techniques, optimizing CNN-based models, and exploring modern AI methods to enhance accuracy in recognizing both printed and handwritten Arabic scripts.
